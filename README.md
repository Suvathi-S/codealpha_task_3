# My Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio! This project is designed to introduce myself, showcase my skills, and provide a way to get in touch. It's built using **HTML** and **CSS** to create a simple yet elegant, responsive design.

## Features

- **Home Page**: A brief introduction about me, including my background and skills.
- **Contact Page**: A section where visitors can find ways to get in touch with me, including a form (or contact information, depending on your design).

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For creating the structure of the pages.
- **CSS**: For styling the pages and making the design responsive and visually appealing
